This contribution is an example on how to launch a sshd daemon in a
chroot'ed environment. The script will generate the files need to run
the container. The script assume there is a bridge which is configured
on the host.

Check the pre-requisite:
      * you can run this script as 'root'
      * your kernel is configured with all the needed container
        functionnality (check the lxc's README file).

You can log to the sshd daemon only as 'root' with the password 'root'


Create the container:
---------------------

	Generates the configuration files, untar the rootfs and
	creates the container.

	./lxc-sshd create

Start the container:
--------------------
		
	Launches in background /usr/sbin/sshd in the container.		
	
	./lxc-sshd start

Stop the container:
-------------------

	Kills all the processes belonging to the container, sshd and
	the connected clients.

	./lxc-sshd stop

Destroy the container:
----------------------

	Removes the generated files and destroy the container

	./lxc-sshd destroy

Status of the container
-----------------------

	Give the state of the container, if the container is destroyed, the command will fail.

	./lxc-sshd status
